### To install:

  1. Download the code, e.g. `git clone git@github.com:omgmog/chrome-add-link-to-trello.git`
  2. Navigate chrome to `chrome://extensions`
  3. Check the `Developer mode` toggle

  5. Select the folder containing the extension
  
You will need to generate an API key on Trello to use this, you can get one here: https://trello.com/app-key and since Trello now no-longer supports creating legacy wildcard origins, you will need to manually generate an authorization token from the same page.
